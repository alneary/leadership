## About Me
I’m driven by a passion for using data and technology to make a positive, lasting impact. Over decades in data science and leadership, I’ve found that the most meaningful outcomes come from empowering others, fostering innovation, and working with integrity. Here’s a glimpse into what guides my approach as a leader:

## My Leadership Values
### Empowerment and Potential:
I find immense joy in helping others realize their potential. Whether it’s guiding a team member through a challenge or coaching someone toward a breakthrough, I’m committed to creating an environment where people can grow both personally and professionally.

### Kindness and Compassion:
I believe that kindness is foundational to effective leadership. People may forget what you say, but they remember how you made them feel. I strive to create inclusive spaces where everyone feels valued, respected, and able to be themselves.

### Integrity and Ethics: 
For me, leadership is about using skills for the greater good. I’m dedicated to ethical decision-making, ensuring that both results and processes are built on honesty, trust, and responsible use of technology.

### Collaboration and Inclusion: 
I thrive in collaborative environments where diverse perspectives are encouraged. I aim to foster meaningful conversations and ensure everyone has a voice at the table.

### Accountability and Dependability: 
If I say I’m going to do something, I follow through. I believe in holding myself and others accountable, as it’s a key driver of growth and trust within teams.

### Continuous Learning and Growth: 
I’m constantly seeking feedback, investing in personal development, and sharing what I learn with others. I encourage my team to do the same, teaching them how to solve problems independently and adapt to new challenges.

## What Motivates Me
### Solving Complex, Data-Driven Challenges:
I thrive on figuring out complex problems that unlock new capabilities, whether it’s developing predictive models to improve patient outcomes or creating data pipelines that enhance efficiency.

### Driving Innovation through AI and Advanced Analytics: 
I enjoy translating data into actionable insights that lead to measurable business results, such as cost savings, improved healthcare outcomes, or operational efficiencies. I love planting the seed of an idea and watching it grow, especially when it inspires others to push boundaries and try new things.

### Supporting Team and Mental Well-Being: 
I take seriously the role a leader plays in a team’s mental health. I create a positive environment where team members are encouraged to take risks, embrace challenges, and achieve personal and professional growth.

### Creating Opportunities for Courage: 
I encourage others to take risks, try challenging things, and develop resilience, knowing that this is how both individuals and teams reach their highest potential.

I’m passionate about building teams that make a real difference, whether that’s through data-driven insights or ethical, innovative use of technology. I believe that leadership is about more than achieving goals—it’s about creating a positive, lasting impact on the people and the world around us.
